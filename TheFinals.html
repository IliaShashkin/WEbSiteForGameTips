        <ul>
            <li><strong>Play Your Way:</strong> Whether it’s sneaking up on enemy squads
                with a katana in hand or ripping an entire building out from under their
                feet with explosives, THE FINALS lets YOU make the call! With different skills
                across body builds and a wide array of weapons and gadgets, you'll have all the tools to make your playstyle your own!</li>
            
            <li><strong>The World Is Your Weapon (And Enemy):</strong> A skilled contender might go in
                guns blazing, but with environmental destruction in your arsenal, that’s just the start
                of what you can wield against your foes! All of our arenas can be altered, used, or reduced
                to rubble - and not just by you.</li>
            <li><strong>Master Your Loadouts:</strong> Customize your arsenal with a variety of weapons and
                abilities, then fine-tune your setup to complement your unique style of play. Whether you prefer
                precision or power, adaptability is key to dominating the arena.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep Moving, Stay Alive:</strong> Agility is your best friend! In the fast-paced world of
                THE FINALS, staying on the move is crucial. Stand still, and you might not last long.
                Dash, dodge, and outmaneuver your opponents to stay one step ahead.</li>
            <li><strong>Play for the Objective:</strong> Victory isn’t just about racking up kills.
                Stay focused on the game’s objectives and work with your team to secure the win.
                Strategy and teamwork are just as important as combat skills in this competition!</li>
